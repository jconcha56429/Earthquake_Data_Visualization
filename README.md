# Earthquake_Data_Visualization

In this assignment I display my ability to do basic web-mapping with leaflet and mapbox. I use data from an earthquake API (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to show where the earthquake took place within the past 30 days. In addition I also used the radius of the circles to show  the magnitude of each earthquake and each circle is clickable to display the more significant data. I used the chroma library to easily scale the color scheme for the circles and legend which shows the depth in (m). Besides the plotted earthquakes you can also select the tectonic plates control to show the polygons for the tectonic plates in the world. Notably the API key which is present in the config.js file is not mine, but a public API key for mapbox.com, so my githubio should remain permanently visible as long as the public API key is accessible.
